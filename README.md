**Learn modern animation techniques from theory to implementation using C++, OpenGL, and Vulkan**

## What is this book about?
If you‘re fascinated by the complexities of animating video game characters and are curious about the transformation of model files into 3D avatars and NPCs that can explore virtual worlds, then this book is for you.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create simple OpenGL and Vulkan applications and work with shaders
* Explore the glTF file format, including its design and data structures
* Design an animation system with poses, clips, and skinned meshes
* Find out how vectors, matrices, quaternions, and splines are used in game development
* Discover and implement ways to seamlessly blend character animations
* Implement inverse kinematics for your characters using CCD and FABRIK solvers
* Understand how to render large, animated crowds efficiently
* Identify and resolve performance issues
